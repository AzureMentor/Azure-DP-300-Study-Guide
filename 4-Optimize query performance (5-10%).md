## Review query plans

* determine the appropriate type of execution plan
  * live Query Statistics
  * Actual Execution Plan
  * Estimated Execution Plan
  * Showplan
* identify problem areas in execution plans
* extract query plans from the Query Store

## Evaluate performance improvements
* determine the appropriate Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) to gather query
performance information
* identify performance issues using DMVs
* identify and implement index changes for queries
* recommend query construct modifications based on resource usage
* assess the use of hints for query performance

## Review database table and index design
* identify data quality issues with duplication of data
* identify normal form of database
* assess index design for performance
* validate data types defined for columns
* recommend table and index storage including filegroups
