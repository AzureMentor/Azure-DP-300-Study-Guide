# DP-300: Monitor and Optimize Operational Resources (15-20%)

## Monitor activity and performance

* prepare an operational performance baseline
* determine sources for performance metrics
* interpret performance metrics
* assess database performance by using Azure SQL Database Intelligent Performance
* configure and monitor activity and performance at the infrastructure, server, service, and
database levels

## Implement performance-related maintenance tasks
* implement index maintenance tasks
* implement statistics maintenance tasks
* configure database auto-tuning
* automate database maintenance tasks
  * Azure SQL agent jobs
  * Azure automation
  * SQL server agent jobs
* manage storage capacity

## Identify performance-related issues
* configure Query Store to collect performance data
* identify sessions that cause blocking
* assess growth/fragmentation of databases and logs
* assess performance-related database configuration parameters including:
  * AutoClose
  * AutoShrink
  * AutoGrowth

## Configure resources for optimal performance
* configure storage and infrastructure resources
  * optimize:
    * IOPS
    * throughput
    * latency
  * optimize tempdb performance
  * optimize data and log files for performance
* configure server and service account settings for performance
* configure Resource Governor for performance

## Configure a user database for optimal performance
* implement database-scoped configuration
* configure compute resources for scaling
* configure Intelligent Query Processing (IQP)
